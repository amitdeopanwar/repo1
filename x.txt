this is another line added since i see you haven't created branch. i will wait for you to branch out. then once you have branched out i will commit and push these changes to master.

This is another non-pushed line added next day. lets see what happens


# I just removed those weird looking >>>> and <<<< lines.

function say_hi() {
    echo "Hi Amit!";
}

# Wed May 16 12:39:22 PDT 2012

function bonjour() {
    echo "Bonjour! Commen tallez vous?";
}
